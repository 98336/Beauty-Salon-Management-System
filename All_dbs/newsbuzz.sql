I mean, how tough can this be - you splash water on your face, rub in the cleanser and then rinse. Over the top, this is how you do it yes, but if you want to know how to properly wash your face, then today you will take away a thing or two. To begin with, not cleansing your face correctly can lead to skin problems like acne or dullness. In addition, any skincare product you apply thereafter, will not penetrate your skin fully, as there is still uncleared debris on your skin. Not just that, having a squeaky clean face also has to do with the fact about when, how often and what kind of cleanser you use. Simply cleansing your face right will shoo away all these problems, so what are we waiting for? Let&rsquo;s begin.\r\nHow To Wash Face Correctly?\r\nThe duration\r\nAs a thumb rule, you should massage your face for a minimum of 30 seconds to 1 minute. Any less and the product did not have enough time to clean your skin, any more, you might dry out your skin.\r\nThe quantity\r\nIt might seem the more product you use, the better results you reap. But, that&rsquo;s not the case. Always follow the quantity mentioned on the product. If there isn&rsquo;t any, then a coin-sized amount should suffice.\r\nThe water temperature\r\nYour face&rsquo;s skin is waaayy thinner and sensitive than the rest of your body. So, even though you might love those long hot showers, always cleanse your face with lukewarm water. Why? Couple of reasons here. Hot water can dilate blood vessels and cause breakage in the delicate tissue. It can also dry out your face, making it scaly over time.\r\nThe frequency\r\nIdeally, you should be cleansing your face twice a day - once in the morning and once before bed. Although, if you do have extremely dry and sensitive skin then you may swap the morning wash with a water-only rinse. But say, if there is excessive sweating after a workout or so, you should use a cleanser.\r\nThe perfect match\r\nDo you feel as if your skin is greasy even after cleansing? Or does it feel too tight or rough after you&rsquo;ve cleansed it? In both cases, you can be using the wrong cleanser. You need a gentle and creamy cleanser if your skin tends to be dry and sensitive. Those with oily skin should pick a gel or foam based cleanser. If your skin is prone to acne, pick a cleanser with ingredients like tea tree oil or salicylic acid for best results.\r\nThe additional step\r\nGuess what, learning how to wash face correctly may require an extra step. It&rsquo;s for those who wear long-wear, smudge-proof makeup, where your gentle cleanser may not cut through. What you need here is micellar water, or an oil-based cleanser. This is the concept of double cleansing. You melt away stubborn makeup using either of these, then follow up with your regular water-based cleanser. Doing this will eliminate traces of makeup and dirt like no other.\r\nThe right order\r\nSplash your face with lukewarm water, take a sufficient amount of your cleanser and massage your face, jaw and neck for 30 seconds - 60 seconds. Then thoroughly rinse, and you&rsquo;re done! Always ensure that you&rsquo;re using a clean face towel and following up with moisturiser.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;', '2023-10-22 13:54:14', 'published', 'Face wash'),

While the two conditions may look and feel similar, they are very different. Dry skin is caused by a lack of oil production, while dehydration is caused by a lack of water in the skin. Understanding the difference between these two conditions is essential to finding the right treatment and achieving healthy, glowing skin. In this article, we will discuss the differences between dryness and dehydration, as well as how to identify them and treat them effectively.\r\nDry skin is a skin type that doesn&#39;t produce enough oils to keep your skin moisturised and protect it from the environment.&nbsp; Whereas dehydrated skin lacks water and moisture in the uppermost layer of the skin. The loss in water can disrupt the skin&rsquo;s barrier and can cause your skin to feel itchy, tight and uncomfortable. Dehydrated skin can happen to varying skin types: oily, normal, combination and acne-prone.\r\nHow to identify if your skin is dry or dehydrated?\r\nThe easiest way to tell if your skin is dehydrated is if you pinch your cheek or the back of your hand and it wrinkles with slight pressure instead of bouncing back. Dehydrated skin will also appear dull and feel tight. On the other hand, dry skin is characterised by lack of oil. So, think flaky, rough and itchy skin. It&rsquo;s vital to understand if your skin is dehydrated or dry, as your choice of moisturisers would depend on it.\r\nHow to treat dry and dehydrated skin?\r\nIf you have dry skin then stick to using cream-based and oil-based skincare products to tackle this condition. If you think your skin is dehydrated, then stick to using humectants that will attract moisture to your skin. You should steer clear from products that strip the skin of water. Look for ingredients like squalane,&nbsp;ceramides&nbsp;and peptides that will aid in hydrating your skin, maintaining your skin health, improving your skin&nbsp;barrier&nbsp;and calming inflammation.\r\nTo combat dry skin incorporate a moisturising cleanser, sunscreen deemed fit for the pertinent skin type. You may look for ingredients like HA and paraffin that give your skin the adequate amount of hydration, round the clock.\r\nFor dehydrated skin, use formulations that will help repair the marred acid mantle while also dwindling episodes of inflammation. Usage of soothing ingredients like Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, Avocado Oil and Olive Oil along with ceramides would be recommended. If you are grappling with dehydrated skin it is advisable to steer clear of actives, from time to time. Case in point:If you have a combination or oily skin type (generally) which is dehydrated at the moment &mdash; directing efforts towards treating the skin barrier should take precedence over your regular administration of active-imbued skincare.\r\n&nbsp;', '2023-10-22 13:54:20', 'published', 'dry, dehydrated'),
(45, 'THE BEST ANTI-AGING SKIN CARE ROUTINE', 'SARA', '2023-10-22', '929224.jpg', 'How many of you remember actress&nbsp;Ira Dubey&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Olay&nbsp;ad? The 20 something actress talked about her carefree attitude to skincare till she had it professionally evaluated, only to discover she had age spots, fines lines, the works. Oh horror! Still, the dizzying range of anti-aging skincare products with their long lists of ingredients can be off putting. We&rsquo;ll show you where to start and how to find the right anti-aging skin strategy for girls in their 20s and 30s.\r\nHere are some of the best anti-ageing skin care tips nobody told you before:\r\n1. Prevention is the first step\r\nThis doesn&rsquo;t mean you should rush off to your dermatologist and ask for Botox and Fillers to smooth out barely-there lines! Instead start by taking care of your skin, with a sensible skin care routine, sun protection, a healthy diet and not smoking. Don&rsquo;t ever leave home without sun protection. In fact apply it indoors and outdoors even on cloudy days. Take your pick from&nbsp;Neutrogena UltraSheer Dry Touch Sunblock SPF 50+,&nbsp;Lakme Sun Expert SPF 50 PA+++ Ultra Matte Gel Sunscreen&nbsp;Sebamed Multiprotect Sunsreen SPF 50+&nbsp;or&nbsp;Kaya Sweat Proof Sunscreen SPF 30+&nbsp;depending on your skin type. It won&rsquo;t hurt to take a daily skin loving multivitamin too like&nbsp;Purayati Vitamins For Hair Skin And Nails - 90 Tablets. &nbsp;\r\nMost anti-aging creams are targeted at the above 40 set, so do you really need a tightening potion when you&rsquo;re still young? Skin expert Dr. Dhimant Goleria says, &ldquo;Women enter a &lsquo;pre-age&rsquo; phase in their late 20s to mid-30s when barely noticeable fine lines around the mouth and sun spots first start showing up.&rdquo; His advice: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sensible for women in their mid-20s to start using appropriate skin care to ward off skin aging.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n2. Start small and build from there\r\nThis doesn&rsquo;t mean you should rush out and stockpile every anti-aging potion you can lay your hands on. Start by integrating one new product instead of an army of heavy hitters. Adding one formula that sun protects, hydrates and evens out your skin tone is more than enough. Try&nbsp;Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Ageing Revitalizing Serum&nbsp;an intensive treatment with&nbsp;anti ageing ingredients such as Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5, Green Tea Extract, Allantion and Glycerin. Another good option is&nbsp;Olay Total Effects 7 In One Anti-Ageing Skin Cream Day / Normal&nbsp;that fights the first signs of skin aging; dark spots, loss of elasticity, lines, wrinkles, uneven skin tone and open pores. Apply this twice a day after your toner and before your moisturizer or foundation.\r\n3. Retinol: To use or not to use?\r\nSure it&rsquo;s the proven gold standard in anti-aging skin care routine because of its proven benefits in treating blemishes, uneven tone and regenerating collagen. So isn&rsquo;t a retinoid cream the one you should pick right away? No! It isn&rsquo;t the case of one size fits all. While retinols can increases cell cycle turnover, decreases pore size and reduce sun damage, it may not be the best option for you. Retinoids can cause flare-ups on acne prone skin while dry skins can get even drier.&nbsp;Instead look for products with tiny concentrations of Retinol, and a mix of Alpha Hydroxy Acid and antioxidants such as&nbsp;Kaya Brightening Night Cream&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lakme Youth Infinity Skin Sculpting Day Creme SPF 15 ++As for your nighttime routine, look no further than Ponds Age Miracle Wrinkle Corrector Night Cream that works on all skin types at every age. It is specially designed to speed up cell renewal while simultaneously stimulating your skin from within work on all skin types at every age. And don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of an eye cream.&nbsp;Lakme Absolute&rsquo;s Argan Oil Radiance Night Revival Eye Cream&nbsp;is a non-sticky formula that&rsquo;s enriched with moroccan argan oil and Opti Glow Complex that works wonders at night. &nbsp;\r\n4. Revise your morning skin care routine\r\nStart your day with an antioxidant-rich potion that contains peptides and plant stem cells because of their preventive qualities.&nbsp;Since air pollution and the sun&rsquo;s rays are the source of free radicals that damage living cells causing aging, its sensible to use an antioxidant-rich formula before stepping out for the day, says Dr. Goleria.&nbsp;You could use&nbsp;Himalaya Herbals Nourishing Skin Cream&nbsp;that contains herbal extracts of Aloe Vera, Winter Cherry and India Kino tree extracts that moisturize, nourish and protect against pollution. Or try&nbsp;Fabindia Vitamin E Cream De-Pigmentation&nbsp;that is blended with Vitamins A, C and E to provide deep hydration and optimal skin protection from harmful UVA and UVB rays.\r\n5. Skin smart tip: Use a moisturizing sunscreen\r\nWe can&rsquo;t stress enough how important sunscreen is. Instead of slathering on multiple layers of formula on your face, get skin smart by buying a moisturizing sunscreen formula; it keeps skin soft and supple and protects against sun induced photo aging. Remember not to fall into the trap of lavishing all your attention only on your face. &ldquo;Get into the good habit of applying sunscreen on your neck, d&eacute;colletage, arms, hands and feet as well. In fact, all visible skin should be sun protected,&rdquo; says Dr. Goleria. Your neck and hands are where sun damage start showing up. &nbsp;Use&nbsp;Age Lock SPF 40 Multi-Vitamin, a double action sunscreen that is also infused with multi vitamins that protect skin from harmful rays and pollution to give you a healthy glow.&nbsp;Nivea Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 50&nbsp;is also a good option. It not only protects against harmful UVA and UVB rays but also helps maintain essential hydration and nourishment. Another broad-spectrum hero is&nbsp;Lakme Sun Expert SPF 50 PA+++ Ultra Matte Gel Sunscreen. Its gel texture allows you to face the sunscreen with confidence since it glides on effortlessly and barely feels like you are wearing anything.', '2023-10-22 13:50:44', 'published', 'anti aging'),
(46, 'REVEALED: THE MANY BENEFITS OF AN OIL MASSAGE FOR YOUR HAIR', 'SARA', '2023-10-29', '278595.jpg', 'Everyone has different hair types, and it&rsquo;s difficult to know what solution would suit your hair concern. Trying out every solution you come across might not be the best idea for the overall health of your hair. So, whenever I face any hair problems, I like to go by the old school: my grandma&rsquo;s home remedies. Out of all the&nbsp;haircare&nbsp;solutions she has passed on to me, a scalp massage for hair growth has immensely boosted my hair&rsquo;s health. Pampering my hair with a head massage oil nourishes my hair from within and makes it softer and stronger. However, she always lays emphasis on the right method of oil massage for hair. Here is an easy guide on how to massage your scalp. Head Massage Benefits 1. Strengthens Hair And Roots If you are experiencing flat and limp hair, extreme dryness, excess oily scalp, split ends, and hair breakage, your hair roots might be weak and undernourished. Massaging oil onto the scalp strengthens the roots and helps boost blood circulation, giving you healthy lustrous hair. Hair oils like coconut oil or virgin olive oil can also unclog your hair follicles and promote better absorption of nutrients in your scalp. Dos: Massage oil gently onto your scalp with your fingers in a circular motion. Dont&#39;s: Never apply oil to your scalp rigorously. It can weaken your roots more and cause hair fall. 2. Keeps Away Dandruff And Itchiness Often, we use chemical-based products that strip our scalp of moisture and nutrients, causing dehydration. A dehydrated scalp results in flaking, itching and broken skin and is less effective in protecting your hair against the environment, leading to dandruff and infections. Oil massage for hair effectively hydrates your scalp and keeps dandruff at bay. Head massage benefits you by stimulating the oil glands to produce more natural oil keeping your scalp healthy and nourished. Dos: If your scalp is prone to dandruff, use a lightweight hair oil. It would be best to avoid oils which have a thick consistency, like castor oil. Dont&#39;s: Do not keep oil in your hair overnight if you have an oily scalp. For dry or damaged hair, massage your scalp and hair shafts with warm oil, 1 to 2 hour before washing off with a mild&nbsp;shampoo. 3. Nourishes Your Scalp Remember how your skin feels soft, plump and glossy when you hydrate it sufficiently? Well, your scalp is an extension of your skin and so feels the same after an oil massage. The best massage oils nourish the scalp, making it healthier. A good oil massage with the right kind of oil penetrates deep into the scalp, nourishing the hair follicles and hair shaft from within, helping them grow faster and stronger. Dos: Identify your hair type. If you have an oily scalp, keep oil in your hair for only an hour before shampoo. Dont&#39;s: Avoid stepping out after a scalp massage. Dirt can stick to your scalp, clogging pores, causing dandruff and hair fall. 4. Reduces Frizz And Split Ends Pollution, UV rays and other environmental aggressors can cause split ends, dryness, frizz and breakage. Oil forms a protective layer on the scalp, protecting your roots from dryness, harmful rays and pollution. It also provides deep conditioning that makes your hair more resistant to damage and hair fall. Dos: Detangle your hair before oiling with a wide tooth comb to avoid breakage. Dont&#39;s: Avoid brushing your hair with a comb or tying it in a tight braid or ponytail after oil massage. How To Do Scalp Massage For Hair Growth With a hot oil treatment, you can reap the maximum benefits of a head massage. Take your preferred&nbsp;hair oil&nbsp;in a bowl and heat it through the double boiler method. When it is warm enough (not hot!), take a few drops in your palms, rub them together and apply on your roots and hair. Lightly coat your hair&rsquo;s entire length too. Once you apply the oil, use your fingertips to gently massage your scalp all over. Avoid massaging for too long if you are suffering from hair fall. To let the oil penetrate deeper into the scalp, wrap a warm towel over your head and wash it off after an hour. You can repeat it thrice a week. If you have oily hair, restrict this head massage to once a week. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;', '2023-10-29 04:13:30', 'published', 'massage'),

Thankfully, it&#39;s a form of&nbsp;ice&nbsp;therapy that you can easily do at home.\r\nMuch like cryotherapy (treatments using cold temperatures), and CoolSculpting (that breaks down fat cells), skin icing harnesses the power of ice to help boost circulation, improve redness and tackle&nbsp;breakouts.\r\nWhat is skin icing?\r\n&ldquo;Skin icing, also known as cold therapy or ice facials, is the process of gently applying ice or a cold compress to the skin. This technique aims to enhance the appearance of the skin by improving circulation, reducing&nbsp;inflammation, and promoting a healthy complexion.&rdquo;\r\nWhat are the benefits of skin icing?\r\nImproved&nbsp;circulation\r\n&ldquo;Cold temperatures constrict blood vessels, and when the skin is exposed to ice, blood flow is momentarily reduced. When the skin is warmed after icing, blood vessels dilate, promoting better circulation and delivering essential nutrients to the skin. You can also expect reduced&nbsp;puffiness and&nbsp;inflammation, as icing helps to shrink blood vessels and reduce inflammation, which can effectively decrease&nbsp;under-eye bags and swelling. This is particularly useful after a sleepless night or to counteract morning&nbsp;puffiness.&rdquo;\r\nSoothing irritated skin\r\n&ldquo;Cold therapy can soothe and calm irritated or sensitive skin, providing relief from redness and discomfort,&nbsp;and&nbsp;may&nbsp;temporarily tighten and minimise the appearance of pores, creating a smoother skin texture.&nbsp;Applying ice before your skincare routine can help products penetrate more effectively, maximising their&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;too.&rdquo;\r\nHow should I prepare for skin icing?\r\n&ldquo;I&#39;d recommend you begin with a gentle cleanser to remove any&nbsp;makeup, dirt, or oil from the face. You can use ice cubes, ice packs, or specially designed ice globes. Wrap the ice in a thin cloth or plastic wrap to avoid direct contact with the skin.&nbsp;Ensure your face is dry and free of excess moisture, and then start with a&nbsp;patch&nbsp;test. If you&#39;re new to skin icing, perform a patch test on a small area of skin to ensure there are no adverse reactions.&rdquo;  Sharing the technique, he explains: &ldquo;Hold the ice or ice globe wrapped in a cloth and gently massage it in circular motions over different areas of your face. Focus on one area at a time, such as the forehead,&nbsp;cheeks, and jawline.&nbsp;Limit each icing session to around 5-10 minutes to avoid excessive cold exposure, and after icing, continue with your regular skincare routine. The cooled skin may better absorb products.&rdquo;\r\nWhat can I expect after skin icing?\r\n&ldquo;After skin icing, you may notice a refreshed and awakened appearance, puffiness and redness should be visibly reduced. Your skin may feel tighter and smoother due to&nbsp;minimised&nbsp;pores.&rdquo;\r\nAre there any possible side effects to skin icing?\r\n &#34;While skin icing is generally safe, some individuals may experience redness or&nbsp;irritation - a&nbsp;slight pinkish hue is normal after icing but should subside within a short time.&nbsp;Applying ice directly to the skin without proper insulation can lead to cold&nbsp;burns. Always wrap the ice in a cloth or plastic wrap.  &ldquo;I recommend incorporating skin icing into your skincare routine for its numerous benefits - but with proper preparation and mindful application.&nbsp;Remember to pay attention to your skin&#39;s response and adjust the frequency of icing to suit your individual needs. If you have any concerns or experience persistent&nbsp;side effects, it&#39;s always advisable to consult a skincare professional.&rdquo;', '2023-10-22 13:35:11', 'published', 'skin icing'),

HERE&#39;S WHY.', '', '2023-10-22', '816794.jpg', 'When you shop for your sunblock, it&rsquo;s imperative that you choose a formula that ensures continuous coverage and most importantly a product that you enjoy&mdash;something that you&rsquo;re actually going to use. And to be honest, despite being an editor with the privilege of getting access to a gazillion products for testing and reviewing, I&rsquo;ve often struggled to find the right sunscreen that&rsquo;s nice to my skin\r\nSo, I dove into some research this month and discovered an influx of articles and reviews from fellow publications about mineral sunscreens&mdash;I was apparently late to the party because EVERYBODY had moved to mineral sunscreens already. This got me to try a few in the market (because FOMO, you see?). Plus, I just had to see what the hype was all about. Post testing a couple of formulas last week, it&rsquo;s safe to say that I won&rsquo;t be moving back to my regular chemical sunscreen anymore. The benefits got me to stay (more on this below). Ahead, details on what they exactly contain, a couple of strong benefits and a few of my personal recommendations that actually work.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWHAT ARE MINERAL SUNSCREENS?\r\nThey are typically powered with minerals like zinc oxide and titanium oxide that provide a barrier between your skin and the sun&rsquo;s rays that help deflect the harmful radiations. Also commonly known as physical blockers, they are safer to use for children and those with sensitive skin. They offer full-spectrum protection, easy to apply and no, if applied evenly they do not leave a white cast on your skin. They also provide immediate protection on application&mdash; you can slap it on at the last minute (unlike chemical sunscreens that take time to activate). Oh, and they last longer in direct sunlight which means that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about the hassle of constantly reapplying.', '2023-10-22 13:39:41', 'published', 'Sunscreen'),
(44, 'Do you have sensitive skin? A dermatologist wants you to stay away from these ingredient combinations', 'SARA', '2023-10-22', '203520.jpg', '&nbsp;\r\n&lsquo;Less is more&rsquo; is a good rule of thumb to follow in skincare in general; all the more when you have sensitive skin. Indeed, sensitive skin requires some extra TLC&mdash;and mixing together multiple actives isn&rsquo;t how you&rsquo;re getting it. Actives, when used correctly have transformative powers, no doubt; however when used without the right knowledge, they can have quite the opposite effect. So, this is your periodical reminder about the ingredients that don&rsquo;t mix well together&mdash;least of all if you have sensitive skin.\r\nVitamin C and retinol\r\nVitamic C and&nbsp;retinol&mdash;the two ingredients you&rsquo;re most likely to see on skincare labels&mdash;are highly potent on their own. Used together however is a different story altogether as warns Dr. Renita Rajan, dermatologist who in general is against the concept of layering: &ldquo;A simple routine often does more wonders than adding too many incompatible products, just because &#39;layering&#39; is trending!&rdquo; She strongly warns against layering anything over retinol, particularly Vitamin C. &ldquo;Retinol goes solo on clean, dry skin&mdash;apply lightly, without rubbing since retinol is lipophilic and will make its own way into the skin. Rubbing will only irritate the skin,&rdquo; she explains. Similarly, Vitamin C also makes the skin sensitive. &ldquo;Vitamin C and retinol cannot be layered&mdash;if you must layer, it should be a quenching agent like hyaluronic acid, methylsulfonylmethane and tranexamic acid. If you&rsquo;re using both Vitamin C and retinol, make sure it&rsquo;s at different times,&rdquo; she says.\r\nRetinol and AHAs/ BHAs\r\nAs far as retinol is concerned, you need to tread with caution. AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) and BHAs (beta hydroxy acids) are chemical exfoliants that slough off dead skin&mdash;and should never be paired with retinol. Dr. Rashmi Shetty, dermatologist shares why: &ldquo;Retinols slow down the signs of ageing by increasing the synthesis of collagen and minimising wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots. In contrast, AHAs and BHAs exfoliate the top layer of your skin to promote the development of younger, uniformly-coloured cells. Combining these chemicals might result in irritation or severe dryness.&rdquo;\r\nGlycolic and salicylic acid\r\nTwo other names you&rsquo;re likely to find at your drugstore are glycolic and salicylic acid respectively. Great on their own, but together? Not so much. In fact according to Dr. Shetty salicylic acid should be used carefully even on its own: &ldquo;Avoid using this component unless specifically advised by a skincare expert&mdash;it can be extremely drying and even cause burning and redness in sensitive skin.&rdquo; Dr Chytra V Anand advises against combining both ingredients together: &ldquo;Glycolic acid (an&nbsp;AHA) and salicylic acid (a BHA) together can be too harsh for most skin types. Both are exfoliating agents that can potentially cause skin irritation, dryness, and increased sensitivity when used together. It&#39;s advisable to choose one acid that suits your skin type and concerns and incorporate it into your skincare routine gradually. If you still wish to use both, it&#39;s best to alternate their usage or use products that contain a blend of both acids in balanced concentrations,&rdquo; she says.\r\nChemical and physical exfoliants\r\nToo much of a good thing is a bad thing&mdash;particularly when it comes to exfoliation! &ldquo;Combining exfoliating actives, such as AHAs, BHAs, or enzymes with physical scrubs can lead to over-exfoliation and irritation. Physical scrubs already provide mechanical&nbsp;exfoliation, so adding chemical exfoliants on top can disrupt the skin&#39;s barrier function and cause redness, sensitivity, or even micro-tears,&rdquo; says Dr. Anand.  Like all good things, keep it simple&mdash;your skin will thank you for it.\r\n&nbsp;', '2023-10-22 13:50:54', 'published', 'sensitive skin');
